export const coverLetter = `Two years ago I started coding by myself, learning the basics on Python, to the point of making a character generator for a dungeons and dragons kind game. I remained attached to coding and continued programming whenever I had an idea. 
Then, this year, I entered a Full Stack Developer bootcamp, where I learned JavaScript and TypeScript. 
There I created, along with a team, an e commerce with a calendar feature. 
I continued coding an application of applied symbolic logic.
I have an advanced level on English, reading and communicating. 
I am very fond of AI and feel motivated to work near such environment, for I love manipulation and transformation of data. Fintechs, e commerce, backend environment. I am motivated to learn techniques that open me up to new goals.`
